# javascript-calculator
JavaScript Calculator developed for freeCodeCamp


this project was developed and finalized online using codepen.io

the goal was to develop a calculator app that could correctly evaluate expression/formula logic.

the code as is passes all 16/16 tests in the test suite and can be easily adapted to a local environment. The imports have been converted to work with codepen's babel preprocessor.
